# Accidents-de-la-circulation

In this group project we used the french national road accident database (available on data.gouv.fr), and based on the last five years, we tried to answer the floowing question:

**Does the reduction of cars in Paris make the streets safer for pedestrians?**

To answer this question we used Python for EDA and data cleaning/restructuration and PowerBI for data visualisation. In this repository you will find all the python files and the PBIX file used to answer the above question.
